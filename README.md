# Boot Force

This game was developed in a group of four using the Unity engine.

The goal of the game is to reach the top of the tower as a boot!
From the main screen, you should see the boot in question and and bar;
the longer you hold down the spacebar, the more it charges and the further the boot will travel. 

From the main screen, jump to the left to go to the store; jump to the right to go to the castle.
Once inside, try to jump your way to the top!

Good luck!
